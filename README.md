# USBikeshareX
The US Bikeshare is an american project based on sharing system of public bikes.
This project was designed to explore a dataset from the US Bikeshare, as it takes input from a user and returns back some filtered data about some features.
The user is asked to give info about the desired day of the week to look for as well as the month.
The code then returns some answers about the users, places, routes , and times which the project runs into.
This project uses Python3, Pandas & NumPy.
